# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
## MODULE 19 - NEURAL NETWORKS & DEEP LEARNING MODELS

### OVERVIEW
The purpose of this module was to build on the last 2 modules material on Supervised & Unsupervised Machine Learning and take these to the next level of Neural Networks, which is a Machine Learning technique that is modeled after the inner workings of neurons in the human brain.

### RESULTS
#### DATA PROCESSING:
* WHAT VARIABLE(S) ARE CONSIDERED THE TARGET(S) FOR YOUR MODEL?

* WHAT VARIABLE(S) ARE CONSIDERED TO BE THE FEATURES FOR YOUR MODEL?

* WHAT VARIABLE(S) ARE NEITHER TARGETS NOR FEATURES, AND SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM THE INPUT DATA?

#### COMPILE, TRAIN & EVALUATE THE MODEL:
* HOW MANY NEURONS, LAYERS AND ACTIVATION FUNCTIONS DID YOU SELECT FOR YOUR NEURAL NETWORK MODEL, AND WHY?

* WERE YOU ABLE TO ACHIEVE THE TARGET MODEL PERFORMANCE?

* WHAT STEPS DID YOU TAKE TO TRY AND INCREASE MODEL PERFORMANCE?

### SUMMARY
* SUMMARIZE OVERALL RESULTS
* RECOMMENDATION & EXPLANATION FOR A DIFFERENT MODEL
